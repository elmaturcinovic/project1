                <h3>Subject: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                <h3>Task:</h3>
                <p class="tema tx">In this project, the task was to create a class <i>Polinom</i>, which stores the coefficients in the vector
                    <i><b>KoeficijentiPolinoma</b></i>. It was necessary to support the operators <i><b><<</b></i> and <i><b>>></b></i>, where the operator
                    <i><<</i> prints a polynomial on the screen, starting from members with higher, to members with smaller degrees,
                    while the operator  <i>>></i> allows user to enter polynomials from the keyboard, where the polynomial is entered as
                    a sum monomials (not necessarily sorted by degree). In case of incorrect entry, an exception should be
                    thrown. In addition to numbers, the characters +, -, *, ^ and x can be found in the entry.
                    It is necessary to support the operator  <i>()</i> that receives double value and returns the value of the polynomial
                    at a given point. It is necessary to support the <b>multiplication</b> of polynomials (operator *) in time at
                    least O(n ^ lg3) (where n is the degree of the polynomial to be multiplied), as well as the <b>exponentiation</b>
                    of the polynomial (operator ^).
                    Also, implement the member function <i><b>double NulaPolinoma(double a, double b, double e);</b></i> which, if the
                    values of the polynomials are at points a and b of the opposite sign, returns root of the
                    polynomial, with a precision of at least e, and otherwise throws an exception.
                    Outside the class implement the function <i><b>double PresjekPolinoma(Polinom P, Polinom Q, double a
                        , double b, doluble e);</b></i> which returns a point from the interval [a, b] at which the polynomials P and Q
                    intersect, and throws an exception if <i>(P (a) -Q (a)) * (P (b) -Q (b))> 0</i>.
                    Also implement a function that receives a series of polynomials, and sorts them by size (polynomial P
                    is larger than polynomial Q if the lim <sub>x → + ∞</sub> P (x) / Q (x)> 1).
                    Implement all the functions needed to enable the required functionalities.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Implementation:</h3>
                <p class="tema tx">
                    In the private part of the class the polynomial contains:<br>
                    <i><b>vector&lt;double&gt; KoeficijentiPolinoma; </b></i><br>
                    In this vector, the class Polinom preserves the coefficients of the polynomial, so that the coefficient
                    next to x<sub>i</sub> is stored on the i-th index in the vector.<br>

                    <i><b>friend Polinom MnozenjePolinomaRekurzivno(const Polinom &P, const Polinom &Q); </b></i><br>
                    <i><b>friend Polinom Spoji (Polinom &X, Polinom &Y, Polinom &Z, int n);</b></i><br>
                    <br>
                    The first function is an auxiliary function, which we call when overloading the operator *, which allows
                    the multiplication of polynomials P and Q. It, all together with the function below, represents the implementation
                    of Karatsuba algorithm, which we also can use (with certain modifications) for multiplication of matrices, large integers, etc.<br>
                    If we implemented the multiplication operation in the first way that would come to mind, in which we would multiply each member
                    of the polynomial with each one, for polynomials of degree (n-1) (the length of the coefficient vector is n) we would get the
                    complexity of the algorithm O(n2). If we naively apply the divide and conquer strategy, so that we divide the polynomials P
                    and Q of degree n into two polynomials of degree n/2 (for simplicity, assume that n is the degree of 2, so that n can be written
                    as n = 2i), we get:<br>
                    <b> &emsp;P - polynomial of degree n <br>
                        &emsp;P = P1 + P2*x<sup>n/2</sup> <br>
                        &emsp;Q - polynomial of degree n <br>
                        &emsp;Q = Q1 + Q2*x<sup>n/2</sup><br></b>
                    where the polynomials P1, P2, Q1 and Q2 are polynomials of degree n/2.<br>
                    We see that:<br>
                    <b> &emsp;P*Q = P1*Q1 + x<sup>n/2</sup>*(P1*Q2 + P2*Q1) + x<sup>n</sup>P2*Q2</b><br>
                    where we compute 4 products of polynomials of degree n/2, so we get the complexity:<br>
                    <b> &emsp;T(n) = 4T(n/2) + O(n) = O(n2)</b>,<br>
                    which isn't improvement when we compare it to the first algorithm.
                    The idea is to save one multiplication of polynomials of degree n/2, and we achieve this in the following way:<br>
                    We have that:<br>
                    <b> &emsp;P*Q = P1*Q1 + x<sup>n/2</sup>((P1 + Q1)*(P2 + Q2) - P1*Q1 - P2*Q2)) + x<sup>n</sup>P2*Q2</b>
                    We see that we can get the same result by calculating only the following three products:<br>
                    <b> &emsp; X = P1*Q1<br>
                        &emsp; Y = P2*Q2<br>
                        &emsp; Z = (P1+Q1)*(P2+Q2)<br></b>
                    Now we have: <br>
                    <b> &emsp; T(n) = 3T (n/2) + O(n)</b>,<br>
                    where by solving this recursion we get time complexity O(n<sup>lg3</sup>).
                    In function <i><b>friend Polinom MnozenjePolinomaRekurzivno(const Polinom &P,const Polinom &Q);</b></i>,
                    we divide the polynomials P and Q into P1, P2, Q1 and Q2, and recursively call it to get the polynomials X, Y and Z.
                    After we get these polynomials, we call the function <i><b>friend Polinom Spoji(Polinom &X, Polinom &Y, Polinom &Z, int n);</b></i>,
                    in which we calculate and return the result of the expression:<br>
                    <b> &emsp; P*Q = P1*Q1 + x<sup>n/2</sup>((P1 + Q1)*(P2 + Q2) - P1*Q1 - P2*Q2)) + x<sup>n</sup>P2*Q2</b>
                </p>

                    A dietician wishes to mix two types of foods in such a
                    way that vitamin contents of the mixture contain atleast 8 units of vitamin A and 10
                    units of vitamin C. Food ‘I’ contains 2 units/kg of vitamin A and 1 unit/kg of vitamin C.
                    Food ‘II’ contains 1 unit/kg of vitamin A and 2 units/kg of vitamin C. It costs
                    $50 per kg to purchase Food ‘I’ and $70 per kg to purchase Food ‘II’. Formulate
                    this problem as a linear programming problem to minimise the cost of such a mixture

                    Since the mixture must contain at least 8 units of vitamin A and 10 units of
                    vitamin C, we have the constraints:<br>
                    &emsp;2x + y ≥ 8<br>
                    &emsp;x + 2y ≥ 10<br>
                    Total cost Z of purchasing x kg of food ‘I’ and y kg of Food ‘II’ is<br>
                    &emsp;Z = 50x + 70y<br>
                    Hence, the mathematical formulation of the problem is:<br>
                    &emsp;(1)&emsp; Minimise Z = 50x + 70y <br>
                    subject to the constraints:<br>

                        In the table, we find that smallest value of Z is 380 at the point (2, 4). Can we say
                        that the minimum value of Z is 380? Remember that the feasible region is unbounded.
                        Therefore, we have to draw the graph of the inequality<br>
                        &emsp;50x + 70y < 380 i.e., 5x + 7y < 38<br>
                        to check whether the resulting open half plane has any point common with the feasible
                        region. From the picture above, we see that it has no points in common.<br>
                        Thus, the minimum value of Z is 380 attained at the point (2, 4). Hence, the optimal
                        mixing strategy for the dietician would be to mix 2 kg of Food ‘I’ and 4 kg of Food ‘II’,
                        and with this strategy, the minimum cost of the mixture will be $380.
